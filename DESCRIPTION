Description: Helper functions that interface with the system utilities to learn 
    about the local build environment. Lets you explore 'make' rules to test the
    local configuration, or query 'pkg-config' to find compiler flags and libs 
    needed for building packages with external dependencies. Also contains tools
    to analyze which libraries that a installed R package linked to by inspecting
    output from 'ldd' in combination with information from your distribution 
    package manager, e.g. 'rpm' or 'dpkg'.
